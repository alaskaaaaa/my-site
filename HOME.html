                <p class="p0">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>IT or information technology refers to the development, 
                    maintenance, and use of computer software, systems, and networks</b>.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                     It includes their use for the processing and distribution of data. 
                     Data means information, facts, statistics, etc., <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp gathered together for reference, 
                     storage, or analysis.“<br><br><b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Information technology </b>refers to anything related to computing technology. 
                     <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Internet, for example, comes under the umbrella term IT. So does computer hardware, software, and networking.”
                     
                     <br> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 

                    <b> Software</b> includes all the computer programs – codes and instructions – within a computer.
                      Computers do not work without software. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <b>Hardware</b>, in this context, refers to the physical components
                       of a computer system. The screen (monitor), mouse, and motherboard<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  
                       for example, are hardware items.

<p class="paragraph3">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Ideas of computer</b>   science were first mentioned before the
     1950s under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and Harvard 
     University, where they had discussed and began thinking of computer circuits and numerical calculations.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  
     As time went on, the field of information technology and computer science became 
    more complex and was able to handle <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the processing of more data.
     Scholarly articles began to be published from different organizations<br><br>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <b>Looking at early computing,</b> Alan Turing, J. Presper Eckert, and John Mauchly
      were considered to be some of the major <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pioneers of computer technology in the mid-1900s. 
      Giving them such credit for their developments, most of their efforts<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  were focused on designing the first digital computer.
       Along with that,
      topics such as artificial intelligence began to be <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp brought up as Turing was beginning to question 
      such technology of the time period <br><br>

      
    
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b> Devices have been used to aid computation</b> for thousands of years, probably initially in 
      the form of a tally stick.
       The Antikythera<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, 
       is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspanalog computer,
        and the earliest known geared mechanism. Comparable geared devices did
         not emerge in Europe until the <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp16th century, and 
      it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the
       four basic arithmetical operations<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp was developed.<br><br>

        <p class="paragraph4"><b>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Electronic computers,</b> using either relays or valves, began to appear in
        the early 1940s.
        The electromechanical Zuse Z3, completed <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp in 1941, was the world's
         first programmable computer
        , and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  a complete computing machine.
         During the Second World War, Colossus developed the first electronic digital computer to decrypt<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
          German messages.
          Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. 
          It also<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming
           was carried out using plugs and
           switches to alter the internal wiring.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first r
       ecognizably modern electronic digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Baby, which ran its
        first program<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  on 21 June 1948.<br><br></p>


        <p <p class="paragraph5">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <b>The development of transistors</b> in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories
         allowed a new
         generation of computers to be designed with<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  greatly reduced power consumption. The 
         first commercially available stored-program computer, the Ferranti Mark I, contained<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
          4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison, the first
           transistorized 
        computer developed at the<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  University of Manchester and operational by November 1953,
         consumed only 150 watts in its final version<br><br></p>
         
         

        <p <p class="paragraph6"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Several other breakthroughs</b> in semiconductor technology include the integrated circuit (IC)
          invented by Jack Kilby at Texas<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959,
           the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  (MOSFET) invented by Mohamed Atalla and
            Dawon Kahng at Bell Laboratories in 1959, and the microprocessor invented <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp by Ted Hoff, Federico 
            Faggin, Masatoshi Shima, and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971. These important inventions led 
         to the <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp development of the personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, and the emergence of information
          and communications technology (ICT)<br><br></p>


         <p <p class="paragraph7"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>By the year of 1984, </b>according to the National Westminster Bank Quarterly Review,
           the term 'information technology' had been <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspredefined as "The development of cable
            television was made possible by the convergence of telecommunications and computing
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp technology (…generally known in Britain as information technology).” We then begin 
          to see the appearance of the term in 1990 <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp contained within documents for the International
           Organization for Standardization (ISO)<br><br></p>


           
          <p <p class="paragraph8"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Innovations in technology </b>have already revolutionized the world by the twenty-first century 
as people were able to access different <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  online services. This has changed the workforce drastically
 as thirty percent of U.S. workers were already in careers of this profession.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  136.9 million people
  were personally connected to the Internet, which was equivalent to 51 million households.
  Along with Internet, <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp new types of technology were also being introduced across the globe
  , which has improved efficiency and made things easier across <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the globe.<br><br></p>



 <P <p class="paragraph9"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Along with technology revolutionizing society,</b> millions of processes could be done in seconds.
   Innovations in communication were<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp also crucial as people began to rely on the computer to
    communicate through telephone lines and cable. The introduction of email<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp was a really
   big thing as "companies in one part of the world could communicate by e-mail with suppliers
    and buyers in another <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp part of the world.<br><br></P>

   <p <p class="paragraph10"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <b>Not only personally, computers and technology</b> have also revolutionized the marketing 
    industry, resulting in more buyers of their<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  products. During the year of 2002,
     Americans
     have exceeded $28 billion in goods just over the Internet alone when e-commerce a<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  decade 
     later resulted in $289 billion in sales. And as computers are rapidly becoming more
     sophisticated by the day, they are<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  becoming more used as people are becoming more reliant 
     on them during the twenty-first century.
